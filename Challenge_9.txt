A company has taken a project to build a road in the mountains. Now, the rocks that is being extracted from blasting the mountains will be used for another project by the same company, which is running simultaneously. So the company has planned to transport the rocks using a ropeway network that is already in use. You have been given a list of points where ropeway stations are present as well as their height. Another table shows you the connected points that are already in place. The transportation route needs a starting point, a middle point and and end point, where the starting point altitude is higher than the middle point which will be higher than the end point.

* Each entry in the table stations represents a direct connection between stations with IDs point1 and
point2. Note that all routes are bidirectional.
* Create a query that finds all triplets(startpt, middlept, endpt) representing the ropeway stations
that may be used for the transportations of the rocks.
* Output returned by the query can be ordered in any way.

Assume that:
 for every two stations there is at most one direct route connecting them;
 each point from table stations occurs in table ropeway_stations;
