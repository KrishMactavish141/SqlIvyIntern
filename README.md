# Overview
This repository contains the solutions to 10 SQL challenges that I completed during a comprehensive internship at Ivy Professional School. The internship was designed to progressively enhance SQL skills, starting from basic operations and advancing to more complex queries and real-life scenarios.

# Internship Structure
## Challenge Types
Easy: 2 tasks focused on fundamental SQL operations such as JOIN and GROUP BY clauses.
Medium: 5 tasks that required the use of advanced SQL techniques including Common Table Expressions (CTE), window functions, and self JOINS.
Hard: 3 tasks involving the analysis of complex real-life data, such as identifying top-selling products and customer demographics during peak seasons.
## Rules and Requirements
Question Posting: Challenges were posted on alternate days at 9 AM, with submissions required by 10 AM the following day.
Efficiency: Solutions needed to be optimized, avoiding unnecessary queries or additional columns.
Submission Format: Each submission included a Notepad file containing the query and a separate attachment for the output screenshot. No PDF or Word files were allowed.
Individual Work: All work was completed independently, with strict rules against collaboration to ensure individual learning and problem-solving.
# Project Highlights
Mastery of Basic SQL Operations: Developed a strong understanding of basic SQL operations, including the effective use of JOIN and GROUP BY clauses.
Advanced SQL Techniques: Gained proficiency in using advanced SQL features such as CTEs, window functions, and self JOINS, which are crucial for handling complex queries.
Real-Life Data Analysis: Successfully tackled real-world problems, such as analyzing top-selling products and customer demographics during peak sales periods.
# Repository Structure
Each folder in this repository corresponds to one of the 10 challenges. Inside each folder, you will find:

SQL Query: The query used to solve the challenge, saved in a .sql file.
Output Screenshot: A screenshot of the query output, demonstrating the solution.
# Conclusion
This internship provided a thorough grounding in SQL, from mastering basic operations to tackling complex, real-world data challenges. The skills and techniques acquired during this program have significantly enhanced my ability to work with SQL in various scenarios.
